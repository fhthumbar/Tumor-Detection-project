# Tumor-Detection-project
The Tumor Detection Project focuses on developing a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying tumors as malignant or benign. Leveraging a labeled medical dataset and a Random Forest Classifier, this project applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and rigorous model evaluation techniques to achieve reliable predictions.
